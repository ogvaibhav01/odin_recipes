            <li>1 cup rice (basmati or any long-grain rice)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 medium tomato (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>2-3 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil or ghee</li>
            <li>Fresh coriander leaves (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Water (as needed)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the lentils thoroughly under running water until the water runs clear. Soak them in water for about 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>Rinse the rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy.</li>
            <li>Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the soaked lentils and add them to the pot. Stir to coat the lentils with the spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Add about 3 cups of water (adjust based on the type of lentils used) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer until the lentils are cooked and soft (about 20-30 minutes). You may need to add more water if it gets too thick.</li>
            <li>While the lentils are cooking, drain the soaked rice. In a separate pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the rice and a pinch of salt. Cook until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed (about 15-20 minutes). Fluff the rice with a fork once done.</li>
            <li>Once the lentils are cooked, check the consistency. If it's too thick, you can add a little water to reach your desired consistency. Adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish the daal with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>Serve the hot daal with steamed rice. Enjoy your comforting meal of Daal Chawal!</li>
