        <h2>discription</h2>
        <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular Indian appetizer made from marinated paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cubes that are grilled or baked to perfection. The paneer is typically marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, which gives it a flavorful and tangy taste. The dish is often served with mint chutney and is enjoyed for its smoky flavor and soft texture.</p>
