        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups grated carrots (about 6-7 medium carrots)</li>
            <li>4 cups full-fat milk</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>10-12 cashew nuts (chopped)</li>
            <li>10-12 almonds (chopped)</li>
            <li>10-12 raisins</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash, peel, and grate the carrots using a grater or food processor.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the grated carrots to the boiling milk. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the milk is completely absorbed and the carrots are tender (this may take around 30-40 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the sugar to the carrot and milk mixture. Stir well to combine. The mixture will become slightly liquidy again as the sugar melts.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook on low heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan (about 15-20 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the ghee to the halwa and mix well. Cook for another 5-7 minutes until the ghee is fully incorporated and the halwa has a glossy appearance.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cardamom powder for flavor.</li>
            <li>In a small pan, heat a little ghee and lightly roast the chopped cashew nuts, almonds, and raisins until they turn golden brown. Add these roasted nuts and raisins to the halwa and mix well.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let it cool slightly before serving. Carrot Halwa can be served warm or at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Garnish with additional nuts if desired and enjoy your delicious Carrot Halwa!</li>
